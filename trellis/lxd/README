after customizing the contents of these .yml files, copy them into lxc configuration profiles using the command
lxc profile create 'profilename'
lxc profile edit 'profilename'

before creating your container, be sure that the root user is able to remap the uid and gid of the local filesystem to the container:
sudo echo 'root:1000:1' | sudo tee -a /etc/subuid /etc/subgid

when creating container, use the '-p' switch to specify the correct config profile, ex
lxc launch -p cosadmin -p sarnia-ca ubuntu:bionic local-sarnia-ca
