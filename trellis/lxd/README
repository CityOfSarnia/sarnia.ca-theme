after customizing the contents of these .yml files, copy them into lxc configuration profiles using the following command example:

lxc profile create cosadmin
cat cosadmin.yml | lxc profile edit cosadmin
lxc profile show cosadmin

repeat this for every profile you want to create.

before creating your container, be sure that the root user is able to remap the uid and gid of the local filesystem to the container:
sudo echo 'root:1000:1' | sudo tee -a /etc/subuid /etc/subgid

when creating container, use the '-p' switch to specify the correct config profile, ex
lxc launch -p cosadmin -p sarnia-ca ubuntu:bionic local-sarnia-ca
